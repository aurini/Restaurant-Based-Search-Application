# Restaurant-Based-Search-Application
The main goal of this application is to find the near by restaurants based on the food type that is entered by the user.
User can enter his or her location manually or use GPS to locate himself or herself. 
After that user will enter his food choice, price range of his choice. 
Depending on that this app will search him near by located restaurants name address and phone number.
Tapping on the restaurant name the user can see the menu of the desired restaurnt with the price of the food.
Users can make direct calls to the restaurent for reservation and can also see the location of the restaurant on Google maps.
There is Login system for the owners of restaurent so that they can update the menu, location and price of the food.
